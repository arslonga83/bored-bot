#Scrimba BoredBot project 

This is the first project in the API section - a simple app that calls the boredAPI when you click a button and renders a suggested activity on the screen. I put in a little extra time practicing styles, including media queries, and I also practiced setTimeout and added a robot sound effect during the 'processing' time.
